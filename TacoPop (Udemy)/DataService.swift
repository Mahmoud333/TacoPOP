// Create/Implement the data model or data service
// the reason im using class here is because it will be singleton

class DataService {

    static let instance = DataService()
    
    //what singledon let us do is there's only one instace that lives throughout your whole app, so u can refer to this data service from anywhere and execute functions or access data or whatever, this is a perfect kind of thing for singleton.
