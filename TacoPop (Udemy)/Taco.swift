//subject of value vs reference type comes in, this is perfect place to use struct instead of class. bec. we're going to have a bunch of tacos & none of them need to have references, when we pass them around we want to pass them as copies
//1st i will create enums to deal with different things with tacos

}

    case Plain = 2 //made of cheese
}

    //we r puting all these "!" basically the way im going to set this up for this lesspn is to create a taco u must have all these properties.
    //otherwise u won't be able to initialize the taco
