//empty protocol, don't need to define anything in there

//its good to define requirements in ur protocol itself but dont need here
//define a protocol and implement functionality in the extension

extension DropShadow where Self: UIView{ //extension DropShadow where self is UIView (when u deal with extensions & protocols its "Self" not "self")
   
    //u can constrain ur extension to a certian type, 
    //we do in generics how u constrained a cetrain protocol in a protocol extension can constrain that protocol to a certain type
